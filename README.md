# Avrae Map Planner

To run locally, use `npm run serve`. As you construct your map, the "code box" at the bottom will update with a line you can paste to Avrae to save the map. You can then start it up later by using `!bplan begin <name>`.

## VTT Experiment

- full screen map
- flyout panels when needed
- overlays for spell effects
- lookup token name from db (image, size)
- hp/init tracker?
